# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of DeveloperDAO is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. 
As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in DeveloperDAO to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

## 5. Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at DeveloperDAO events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. 
Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others.
Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.
Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from any DeveloperDAO related media, activities, and discord and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
While holding the required amount of $CODE or the original D4R NFT allows entrance to the discord, it does not guarantee persistent access.
You can and will be removed from the server for repeated violations. 


## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.
This can include any moderator in the D_D Discord for Discord related problems, any GitHub admin for GitHub related problems, and so forth for any additional services.
You can report any violations at the following link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-rOPZf7tYB4ovDMZ0eupXaCnJef8eq8VBgiRS4NkyhPJ9LQ/viewform.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.
In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 8. Addressing Grievances
